We have taken the 'personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease' dataset for our project. Originally, the dataset 
come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which 
conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. According to the 
CDC, heart disease is one of the leading causes of death for people of most races in the US. The original 
dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 18 variables in KAGGLE. This dataset can be 
used to apply a range of machine learning methods, most notably classifier models (logistic regression,
decision tree, KNN, random forest, etc.). So this dataset seems import to use for this project. In this report, 
we exploit the 'personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease' to visualize the distribution of some attributes that 
seem to be correlated to heart disease and use some classification algorithms on the dataset.
